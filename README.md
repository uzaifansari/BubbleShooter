This is a simple game i created using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
I developed this while learning and practising JavaScript.
This game is best viewed on a Desktop or Laptop, as it is not responsive yet.

Basic Overview & How To Play:
1. Hit - This element displays a random number between 0-9. You need to hit the bubble with the same number. Everytime you hit the correct bubble, this number changes to a new random number.
2. Timer - This element displays the timer. The game will be over when the timer hits 0.
3. Score - This element displays the current score. Everytime you hit the correct bubble, the score increases by 10 points.
